description: Review code for bugs, security issues, and style problems
---
When asked to review code, follow these steps:

1. Read each file thoroughly before commenting
2. Check for bugs, logic errors, and edge cases
3. Look for security issues (injection, auth bypass, data exposure)
4. Note style inconsistencies and readability concerns
5. Provide specific, actionable feedback with file paths and line references
6. Suggest fixes, not just problems
