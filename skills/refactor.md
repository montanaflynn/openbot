description: Refactor code to improve structure without changing behavior
---
When refactoring code:

1. Understand the existing behavior before making changes
2. Run any existing tests first to establish a baseline
3. Make small, incremental changes -- one concern at a time
4. After each change, verify tests still pass
5. Focus on: reducing duplication, improving naming, simplifying control flow
6. Do not change public APIs unless explicitly asked to
